# BluJConcepts Github Pages Site

Currently at the moment I am building this github pages profile site to house my journey of learning iOS 13 and Swift 5 using this [Udemy iOS 13 Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/ios-13-app-development-bootcamp/) and re-learning JavaScript Web Development with this course [Udemy Web Development 2019 Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/). I'm doing this as a refresher. Learning Web Development all over again so that I can gain a job developing [React Applications](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/) while also learning [JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures](https://www.udemy.com/course/js-algorithms-and-data-structures-masterclass/) .

My goal is to become a Junior iOS Developer and re-gain my skill set as a Front End Developer learning MongoDB and Postgres. It will take some time and effort but I am up for the challenge.

Leaning on reading documentation about delegates, extensions, and working on understanding parsing Open Weather API data. 

The goal to start 2020 will be to start working with Firebase which will get me to the aspect that I've been needing which is database storage. Then next will be Realm
