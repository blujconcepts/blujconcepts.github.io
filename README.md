# BluJConcepts Github Pages Site

Currently at the moment I am building this github pages profile site to house my journey of learning iOS 13 and Swift 5 using this [Udemy iOS 13 Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/ios-13-app-development-bootcamp/) and re-learning JavaScript Web Development with this course [Udemy Web Development 2019 Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/). I'm doing this as a refresher. Learning Web Development all over again so that I can gain a job developing [React Applications](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/) while also learning [JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures](https://www.udemy.com/course/js-algorithms-and-data-structures-masterclass/) .

My goal is to become a Junior iOS Developer and re-gain my skill set as a Front End Developer learning MongoDB and Postgres. It will take some time and effort but I am up for the challenge.

## Portfolio Website

Here's my  [Portfolio Website](https://blujconcepts.net/) which will also soon get an update



## Plan


I will outline and update this section on a month by month basis for the time being I am solely focused on my iOS Development course for the Month of November 2019!
